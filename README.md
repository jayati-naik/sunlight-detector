# sunlight-detector
Sunlight detector is used to detect sunlight in an inout scene. It's a classification problem, where we will try and identify if there is sunlight in the scene or not. 

## Steps:
1. Find a dataset of videos with sunlight transitions. We also need videos of rooms when we switch light on and off and model should recognize that its not sunlight but artificial light.
2. Goal is to write a classification model which can identify when sunlight came and when it disappeaered
3. It can be a cassification problem. 
    1. Sunlight came : 1
    2. Sunlight disappeared : 0
4. Think about model to be used, loss, evaluation matrics.
